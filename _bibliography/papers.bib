            Multiple Description Coding (MDC) is an error-resilient source coding method designed 
            for transmission over noisy channels. We present a novel MDC scheme employing a neural network based
            on implicit neural representation. This involves overfitting the neural representation for images. 
            Each description is transmitted along with model parameters and its respective latent spaces. 
            Our method has advantages over traditional MDC that utilizes auto-encoders, such as eliminating the need for model training and offering high flexibility in redundancy adjustment. 
            Experiments demonstrate that our solution is competitive with autoencoder-based MDC and classic MDC based on HEVC, delivering superior visual quality.

            Remote control vehicles require the transmission of large amounts of data, and video is one of the most important sources for the driver. 
            To ensure reliable video transmission, the encoded video stream is transmitted simultaneously over multiple channels. 
            However, this solution incurs a high transmission cost. To address this issue, it is necessary to use more efficient video encoding methods that can make the video stream robust to noise. 
            Moreover it should have a less complexity to adapt to the real time requirement. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity, low-latency 2-channel Multiple Description Coding (MDC) solution with an adaptive Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (IDR) frame period, which is compatible with the HEVC standard with adaptive redundancy adjustment. 
            This method shows a better resistance to high packet loss rates with lower complexity.
