##### Phd Student in Image and Video compression.

I am a member of the [mediacoding](https://mediacoding.i3s.unice.fr/) team of I3S Laboratory, where my primary research focuses on error resilience in video and image transmission using Multiple Description Coding. I am working specifically with the HEVC standard and JPEG. Currently, I am working on enhancing compression techniques by applying neural networks.
